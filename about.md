I'm a graduate student at NCSU pursuing my masters in Computer Science. I did my undergrad from Pune Institute of Computer Technology in Computer Engineering. I have done an internship at <a href="https://www.e2open.com/" target="_blank">E2open</a> working on retail analytics and time series data.

I have worked on deep learning, web development and cryptography. Every project that I have done is on my <a href="https://github.com/yashk2810"  target="_blank">github</a>, so check it out.

Deep learning is changing the industry and applying it in every aspect of our lives would be revolutionary. I want to be a part of that journey.

**Actively Seeking Internship Opportunities for Summer 2018.**
