I'm a final year undergraduate student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology majoring in Computer Engineering. I have done an internship at E2open working on retail analytics and maximizing the sale of an item by optimizing its price.

Moreover, I have participated in machine learning contests on Analytics Vidhya.

I have worked on Deep learning(CNN's, RNN's) also. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/yashk2810"  target="_blank">github</a>.

Deep learning is changing the industry and applying it in every aspect of our lives would be revolutionary. I want to be a part of that journey.
