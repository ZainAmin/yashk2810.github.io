I'm an undergraduate student at UET Lahore pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. I have done an internship at <a href="" target="_blank">JSK Robotics Laboratory, The University of Tokyo</a> working on robotics execution failures.

I have worked on deep learning, web development and machine learning. Every project that I have done is on my <a href="https://github.com/ZainAmin"  target="_blank">github</a>, so check it out.

Deep learning is changing the industry and applying it in every aspect of our lives would be revolutionary. I want to be a part of that journey.
