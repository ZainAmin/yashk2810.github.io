I'm a final year undergraduate student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology majoring in Computer Engineering. I have done an internship at <a href="https://www.e2open.com/" target="_blank">E2open</a> working on retail analytics and maximizing the sale of an item by optimizing its price.

I have also participated in machine learning contests on Analytics Vidhya.

I have worked on deep learning, web development and cryptography. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/yashk2810"  target="_blank">github</a>.

Deep learning is changing the industry and applying it in every aspect of our lives would be revolutionary. I want to be a part of that journey.
