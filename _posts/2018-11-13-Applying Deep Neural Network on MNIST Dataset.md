title: Applying Deep Neural Network on the MNIST dataset
---

A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layer. Deep neural
networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine 
translation, audio recognition, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. Deep neural networks 
have produced results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts. In this article we will apply deep neural network on 
MNIST dataset. MNIST is the most studied dataset (<a href='https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/' target="_blank">MNIST</a>) in computer 
vision tasks.

The state of the art result for MNIST dataset has an accuracy of 99.79%. In this article, we will achieve an accuracy of 98.71%.
